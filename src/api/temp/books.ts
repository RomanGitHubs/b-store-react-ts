    title: 'The Chronicles of Narnia',
    description: `
      The Chronicles of Narnia is a series of seven high fantasy novels by British author 
      C. S. Lewis. Illustrated by Pauline Baynes and originally published between 1950 and 1956, 
      The Chronicles of Narnia has been adapted for radio, television, the stage, film and video games. 
      The series is set in the fictional realm of Narnia, a fantasy world of magic, 
      mythical beasts and talking animals. It narrates the adventures of various children who 
      play central roles in the unfolding history of the Narnian world. Except in The Horse 
      and His Boy, the protagonists are all children from the real world who are magically 
      transported to Narnia, where they are sometimes called upon by the lion Aslan to protect 
      Narnia from evil. The books span the entire history of Narnia, from its creation in The 
      Magician's Nephew to its eventual destruction in The Last Battle.
      <br/><br/>
      The Chronicles of Narnia is considered a classic of children's literature and is Lewis's 
      best-selling work, having sold over 100 million copies in 47 languages.`,

    title: 'The Psychology of Money',
    description: `
      Doing well with money isn't necessarily about what you know. 
      It's about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, 
      even to really smart people. Money--investing, personal finance, 
      and business decisions--is typically taught as a math-based field, 
      where data and formulas tell us exactly what to do. But in the 
      real world people don't make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. 
      They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where 
      personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, 
      marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together. 
      In The Psychology of Money, award-winning author Morgan Housel 
      shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think 
      about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of 
      life's most important topics.`,

    description: `
      The Picture of Dorian Gray is a philosophical novel by Irish writer 
      Oscar Wilde. A shorter novella-length version was published in the 
      July 1890 issue of the American periodical Lippincott's Monthly Magazine.
      The novel-length version was published in April 1891.
      <br/><br/>
      The story revolves around a portrait of Dorian Gray painted by Basil Hallward,
      a friend of Dorian's and an artist infatuated with Dorian's beauty. 
      Through Basil, Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton and is soon enthralled 
      by the aristocrat's hedonistic worldview: that beauty and sensual 
      fulfillment are the only things worth pursuing in life. 
      Newly understanding that his beauty will fade, Dorian expresses the 
      desire to sell his soul, to ensure that the picture, rather than he, 
      will age and fade. The wish is granted, and Dorian pursues a libertine 
      life of varied amoral experiences while staying young and beautiful; 
      all the while, his portrait ages and visually records every one of 
      Dorian's sins.
      <br/><br/>
      Wilde's only novel, it was subject to much controversy and 
      criticism in its time but has come to be recognized as a classic of 
      gothic literature.`,

    title: 'The Two towers',
    description: `
      The Lord of the Rings is composed of six "books", aside from an 
      introduction, a prologue and six appendices. However, the novel 
      was originally published as three separate volumes, due to 
      post-World War II paper shortages and size and price considerations.
      The Two Towers covers Books Three and Four.
      <br/><br/>
      Tolkien wrote: "The Two Towers gets as near as possible to 
      finding a title to cover the widely divergent Books Three and Four; 
      and can be left ambiguous." At this stage he planned to title 
      the individual books. The proposed title for Book Three was The 
      Treason of Isengard. Book Four was titled The Journey of the 
      Ringbearers or The Ring Goes East. The titles The Treason of 
      Isengard and The Ring Goes East were used in the Millennium edition. 
      In other editions the Books are often untitled.
      <br/><br/>
      In letters to Rayner Unwin, Tolkien considered naming the two 
      as Orthanc and Barad-dûr, Minas Tirith and Barad-dûr, or Orthanc 
      and the Tower of Cirith Ungol. However, a month later, he 
      wrote a note published at the end of The Fellowship of the Ring, 
      and later drew a cover illustration, both of which identified the 
      pair as Minas Morgul and Orthanc. In the illustration, Orthanc 
      is shown as a black tower, three-horned, with the sign of the White 
      Hand beside it; Minas Morgul is a white tower, with a thin waning 
      moon above it, in reference to its original name, Minas Ithil, the 
      Tower of the Rising Moon. Between the two towers a Nazgûl flies.`,

      How to Stop Worrying and Start Living is a self-help book by Dale Carnegie. 
      It was first printed in Great Britain in 1948 by Richard Clay (The Chaucer Press), 
      Ltd., Bungay Suffolk (S.B.N. 437 95083 2). It is currently published as a Mass 
      Market Paperback of 352 pages by Pocket (Revised edition: September 15, 1990), ISBN 0-671-73335-4.
      <br/><br/>
      Carnegie says in the preface to How to Stop Worrying and Start Living that he wrote 
      it because he "was one of the unhappiest lads in New York". He said that he made 
      himself sick with worry because he hated his position in life, which he credits for 
      wanting to figure out how to stop worrying.
      <br/><br/>
      The book's goal is to lead the reader to a more enjoyable and fulfilling life, 
      helping them to become more aware of, not only themselves, but others around them. 
      Carnegie tries to address the everyday nuances of living, in order to get the reader 
      to focus on the more important aspects of life. It is now a world-famous, self-help 
      book amongst many people.`,

    description: `
      Award-winning poet Heather Christle has just lost a dear friend to suicide and must 
      reckon with her own struggles with depression and the birth of her first child. 
      How she faces her joy, grief, anxiety, impending motherhood, and conflicted truce with 
      the world results in a moving meditation on the nature, rapture, and perils of crying―from 
      the history of tear-catching gadgets (including the woman who designed a gun that shoots tears) 
      to the science behind animal tears (including moths who drink them) to the fraught role 
      of white women's tears in racist violence.
      <br/><br/>
      Told in short, poetic snippets, The Crying Book delights and surprises, as well as 
      rigorously examines how mental illness can affect a family across generations and 
      how crying can express women’s agency―or lack of agency―in everyday life. Christle’s 
      gift is the freshness of her voice and honesty of her approach, both of which create 
      an intimacy with readers as she explores a human behavior broadly experienced but rarely 
      questioned. A beautiful tribute to the power of crying, and to working through despair to tears of joy.`,

      of the Buendía family. It is a rich and brilliant chronicle of life 
      and death, and the tragicomedy of humankind. In the noble, ridiculous, 
      beautiful, and tawdry story of the Buendía family, one sees all of 
      humanity, just as in the history, myths, growth, and decay of Macondo, 
      one sees all of Latin America. Love and lust, war and revolution, riches 
      and poverty, youth and senility — the variety of life, the endlessness of death, 
      the search for peace and truth — these universal themes dominate the novel. 
      Whether he is describing an affair of passion or the voracity of capitalism 
      and the corruption of government, Gabriel García Márquez always writes with 
      the simplicity, ease, andpurity that are the mark of a master. Alternately 
      reverential and comical, One Hundred Years of Solitude weaves the political, 
      personal, and spiritual to bring a new consciousness to storytelling. 
      Translated into dozens of languages, this stunning work is no less than 
      an accounting of the history of the human race.`,

    description: `The novel chronicles an era that Fitzgerald himself dubbed the "Jazz Age". 
      Following the shock and chaos of World War I, American society enjoyed unprecedented 
      levels of prosperity during the "roaring" 1920s as the economy soared. 
      At the same time, Prohibition, the ban on the sale and manufacture of alcohol as
      mandated by the Eighteenth Amendment, made millionaires out of bootleggers and led to 
      an increase in organized crime, for example the Jewish mafia. Although Fitzgerald, 
      like Nick Carraway in his novel, idolized the riches and glamor of the age, he was 
      uncomfortable with the unrestrained materialism and the lack of morality that went with 
      it, a kind of decadence.`,

      Hamlet's mother. The play vividly charts the course of real and feigned madness—from

    author: 'Fyodor Dostoyevsky',
    title: 'The Brothers Karamazov',
    description: `Dostoevsky's last and greatest novel, The Karamazov Brothers, is both a 
      brilliantly told crime story and a passionate philosophical debate. The dissolute 
      landowner Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov is murdered; his sons — the atheist intellectual Ivan, 
      the hot-blooded Dmitry, and the saintly novice Alyosha — are all at some level involved. 
      Bound up with this intense family drama is Dostoevsky's exploration of many deeply felt 
      ideas about the existence of God, the question of human freedom, the collective nature of guilt, 
      the disastrous consequences of rationalism. The novel is also richly comic: the Russian 
      Orthodox Church, the legal system, and even the author's most cherished causes and beliefs 
      are presented with a note of irreverence, so that orthodoxy and radicalism, sanity and madness, 
      love and hatred, right and wrong are no longer mutually exclusive. Rebecca West considered 
      it "the allegory for the world's maturity, but with children to the fore." 
      This new translation does full justice to Dostoevsky's genius, particularly in the use of 
      the spoken word, which ranges over every mode of human expression.`,

      vast and richly textured canvas of nineteenth-century Russia, the novel's seven major 
      characters create a dynamic imbalance, playing out the contrasts of city and country 
      life and all the variations on love and family happiness. While previous versions have 
      softened the robust, and sometimes shocking, quality of Tolstoy's writing, Pevear and 
      Volokhonsky have produced a translation true to his powerful voice. This award-winning

      a political allegory, a parody of Victorian children’s literature, even a reflection of

    title: 'One Thousand and One Nights',
    description: `One Thousand and One Nights is a collection of Middle Eastern 
      and South Asian stories and folk tales compiled in Arabic during the Islamic 
      Golden Age. It is often known in English as the Arabian Nights, from the first 
      English language edition (1706), which rendered the title as The Arabian Nights' 
      Entertainment. The original concept is most likely derived from an ancient Sassanid 
      Persian prototype that relied partly on Indian elements, but the work as we 
      have it was collected over many centuries by various authors, translators and 
      scholars across the Middle East and North Africa. The tales themselves trace their 
      roots back to ancient and medieval Arabic, Persian, Indian, Egyptian and Mesopotamian 
      folklore and literature. In particular, many tales were originally folk stories 
      from the Caliphate era, while others, especially the frame story, are most probably
      drawn from the Pahlavi Persian work Hazār Afsān. Though the oldest Arabic manuscript 
      dates from the 14th century, scholarship generally dates the collection's genesis to 
      around the 9th century. What is common throughout all the editions of the Nights is 
      the initial frame story of the ruler Shahryar (from Persian: شهريار, meaning "king" 
      or "sovereign") and his wife Scheherazade (from Persian: شهرزاده, meaning "townswoman") 
      and the framing device incorporated throughout the tales themselves. The stories proceed 
      from this original tale; some are framed within other tales, while others begin and end 
      of their own accord. Some editions contain only a few hundred nights, while others include 
      1,001 or more. Some of the best-known stories of The Nights, particularly "Aladdin's 
      Wonderful Lamp", "Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves" and "The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor", 
      while almost certainly genuine Middle-Eastern folk tales, were not part of The Nights 
      in Arabic versions, but were interpolated into the collection by its early European translators.`,

      The novel opens in 1801, with Mr. Lockwood arriving at Thrushcross Grange, 
      a grand house on the Yorkshire moors that he is renting from the surly Heathcliff, 
      who lives at nearby Wuthering Heights. Lockwood is treated rudely, and coldly 
      by the brooding, unsociable Heathcliff, and is forced to stay at Wuthering Heights 
      for a night because one of the savage dogs of the Heights attacks him, and the 
      weather turns against him. The housekeeper cautiously takes him to a chamber to 
      sleep through the night and warns him to not speak to Heathcliff about where he is 
      sleeping, for he would get in deep trouble.`,
