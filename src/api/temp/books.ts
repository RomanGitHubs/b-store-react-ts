    of mythic grandeur, poetic majesty, and symbolic power. Filtered through the 
    consciousness of the novel's narrator, Ishmael, Moby-Dick draws us into a 
    universe full of fascinating characters and stories, from the noble cannibal 
    Queequeg to the natural history of whales, while reaching existential 
    depths that excite debate and contemplation to this day.`,

    famous madeleine; and describes M. Swann's passion for Odette. 
    The work is incomparable. Edmund Wilson said "[Proust] has

    author: 'Gabriel Garcia Marquez',
    title: 'One Hundred Years of Solitude',
    description: `One of the 20th century's enduring works, 
    One Hundred Years of Solitude is a widely beloved and acclaimed 
    novel known throughout the world, and the ultimate achievement 
    in a Nobel Prize–winning career. The novel tells the story of the 
    rise and fall of the mythical town of Macondo through the history
    of the Buendía family. It is a rich and brilliant chronicle of life 
    and death, and the tragicomedy of humankind. In the noble, ridiculous, 
    beautiful, and tawdry story of the Buendía family, one sees all of 
    humanity, just as in the history, myths, growth, and decay of Macondo, 
    one sees all of Latin America. Love and lust, war and revolution, riches 
    and poverty, youth and senility — the variety of life, the endlessness of death, 
    the search for peace and truth — these universal themes dominate the novel. 
    Whether he is describing an affair of passion or the voracity of capitalism 
    and the corruption of government, Gabriel García Márquez always writes with 
    the simplicity, ease, andpurity that are the mark of a master. Alternately 
    reverential and comical, One Hundred Years of Solitude weaves the political, 
    personal, and spiritual to bring a new consciousness to storytelling. 
    Translated into dozens of languages, this stunning work is no less than 
    an accounting of the history of the human race.`,

    Following the shock and chaos of World War I, American society enjoyed unprecedented 
    levels of prosperity during the "roaring" 1920s as the economy soared. 
    At the same time, Prohibition, the ban on the sale and manufacture of alcohol as
    mandated by the Eighteenth Amendment, made millionaires out of bootleggers and led to 
    an increase in organized crime, for example the Jewish mafia. Although Fitzgerald, 
    like Nick Carraway in his novel, idolized the riches and glamor of the age, he was 
    uncomfortable with the unrestrained materialism and the lack of morality that went with 
    it, a kind of decadence.`,

    who has murdered Hamlet's father, the King, and then taken the throne and married Gertrude, 
    Hamlet's mother. The play vividly charts the course of real and feigned madness—from

    author: 'Fyodor Dostoyevsky',
    title: 'The Brothers Karamazov',
    description: `Dostoevsky's last and greatest novel, The Karamazov Brothers, is both a 
    brilliantly told crime story and a passionate philosophical debate. The dissolute 
    landowner Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov is murdered; his sons — the atheist intellectual Ivan, 
    the hot-blooded Dmitry, and the saintly novice Alyosha — are all at some level involved. 
    Bound up with this intense family drama is Dostoevsky's exploration of many deeply felt 
    ideas about the existence of God, the question of human freedom, the collective nature of guilt, 
    the disastrous consequences of rationalism. The novel is also richly comic: the Russian 
    Orthodox Church, the legal system, and even the author's most cherished causes and beliefs 
    are presented with a note of irreverence, so that orthodoxy and radicalism, sanity and madness, 
    love and hatred, right and wrong are no longer mutually exclusive. Rebecca West considered 
    it "the allegory for the world's maturity, but with children to the fore." 
    This new translation does full justice to Dostoevsky's genius, particularly in the use of 
    the spoken word, which ranges over every mode of human expression.`,

    and two primary narrators: Mr. Lockwood and Ellen "Nelly" Dean. 
    The novel opens in 1801, with Mr. Lockwood arriving at Thrushcross Grange, 
    a grand house on the Yorkshire moors that he is renting from the surly Heathcliff, 
    who lives at nearby Wuthering Heights. Lockwood is treated rudely, and coldly 
    by the brooding, unsociable Heathcliff, and is forced to stay at Wuthering Heights 
    for a night because one of the savage dogs of the Heights attacks him, and the 
    weather turns against him. The housekeeper cautiously takes him to a chamber to 
    sleep through the night and warns him to not speak to Heathcliff about where he is 
    sleeping, for he would get in deep trouble.`,
